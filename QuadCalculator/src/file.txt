"Input values are the Quadratic coefficients, a,b,c",
		"For real values of a,b,c which have complex roots/real roots enter like: .'\'QuadCalculator.exe -r 1 2 3 ",
		"For complex values of a,b,c just write .'\'QuadCalculator.exe -cc 1,2 3,4 5,6 here, u have to write the argand coordinates of a,b and c",
		"One tip, if u wanna use square roots in the coefficients, use like 2sqrt3 if it's just sqrt of a number just use then 1sqrtnum"
